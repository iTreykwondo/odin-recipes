    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
      Make this quick and easy BBQ chicken breast in the oven for those times
      when you want a good meal but don't feel like fussing. Nuke a few potatoes
      for baked, steam some fresh broccoli or saute some green beans, and you
      got dinner in about an hour.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>4 whole skin-on, bone-in chicken breasts</li>
      <li>1 cup barbecue sauce (such as Sweet Baby Ray'sÂ®)</li>
      <li>kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking pan
        with heavy-duty foil to make cleanup easier.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare chicken breasts by cutting off the rib meat if you wish; leave
        the skin on. Season chicken with salt and pepper and put in the pan.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until juices start to appear, about 10
        minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove the pan and generously pour 1/2 of the barbecue sauce over
        chicken. Continue to bake for 20 minutes. Repeat with remaining barbecue
        sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cook until no longer pink in the centers and skin is crispy, 15 to 20
        minutes more. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should
        read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
